# ESPN Scrapper

In this project I scrape an IPL data of a website named "ESPN".

## Working 📝

- We provide a link of a match page of ESPN website.
- It gives two outputs:\
=> 1st - Highest wicket taker name,no. of wickets taken by him and his economy in that match.\
=> 2nd - highest sixer name no. of sixes and his strike rate in that match.
