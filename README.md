# ESPN Scrapper

In this project I scrape an IPL data of a website named `ESPN`.

The project uses npm packages `fs`, `cheerio`, and `request` to scrape data from the ESPN website.

The `request` package is used to make HTTP requests to the ESPN website, while `cheerio` is used to parse and manipulate the HTML data that is returned.

The `fs` package is used to write the scraped data to a file for storage or further processing.

## Working üìù

- We provide a link of a match page of ESPN website.
- It gives two outputs :
    - 1st - Highest wicket taker name, no. of wickets taken by him and his economy in that match.
    - 2nd - batsman name who has highest no. of sixed, no. of sixes and his strike rate in that match.

## Tech Stack ‚öí

**Javascript, Nodejs, FS Module, Request & Cheerio.**
