# ESPN Scrapper

In this project I scrape an IPL data of a website named `ESPN`.

## Working 📝

- It gives two outputs :
    - 1st - Highest wicket taker name, no. of wickets taken by him and his economy in that match.
    - 2nd - batsman name who has highest no. of sixed, no. of sixes and his strike rate in that match.
